### Hi I'm Fred ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**cfjhallgren/cfjhallgren** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a PhD student in statistics and machine learning at UCL and occasionally do consulting projects in data science and contribute to open source software.

Here I put some code from my research or hobby projects. I most often use Python, R or C++ on Linux or AWS.

I can be reached at fredrik.hallgren@ucl.ac.uk.
